PROJECT TITLE: Programming Assignment 4
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To demonstrate understanding of text search, sorting methods and arrays.
VERSION or DATE: 12-03-2014

When the program is initiated the user is asked from the following:
	1. Pattern Matching
	2. Sorting Techniques
	3. Exit

If the user enters 1 for pattern matching, then the program asks the user to enter a
string of text. Then the program also asks what to search for within the text.
The program will output the number of times the search was found as well as their
locations.

If the user enters 2 for sorting techniques, then the programs asks whether they want
to use bubble sort or selection sort. Either one will generate and display 10 random 
numbers from 1-100 and sort them based on the technique chosen.

If the user enters 3 to exit the program, then the program returns 0 and exits.
